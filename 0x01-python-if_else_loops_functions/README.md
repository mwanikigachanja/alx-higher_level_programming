# ALX Higher Level Programming - Python 0x01 Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions project within the ALX Higher Level Programming course. This project will help you solidify your understanding of Python's if-else statements, loops, and functions.

## Project Overview

This project consists of several tasks, each designed to test and improve your knowledge of Python's fundamental concepts. In this project, you will:

- Write Python programs to demonstrate your understanding of conditional statements (if-else).
- Create loops to automate repetitive tasks.
- Develop functions to modularize your code and make it more readable and reusable.

## Repository Structure

Here's a brief overview of the project's repository structure:

- `0-positive_or_negative.py`: A Python script that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.
- `1-last_digit.py`: A script that assigns a random number to a variable and then checks the last digit of that number.
- `2-print_alphabet.py`: A script that prints the alphabet in lowercase using a loop.
- `3-print_alphabt.py`: A script that prints the alphabet except for the letters 'q' and 'e'.
- `4-print_hexa.py`: A script that prints numbers from 0 to 98 in hexadecimal format.
- `5-print_comb2.py`: A script that prints all possible combinations of two digits.
- `6-print_comb3.py`: A script that prints all possible combinations of two digits, avoiding duplicates.
- `7-islower.py`: A function that checks if a character is a lowercase letter.
- `8-uppercase.py`: A function that converts a lowercase string to uppercase.
- `9-print_last_digit.py`: A function that prints the last digit of a number.
- `10-add.py`: A function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- `11-pow.py`: A function that calculates a to the power of b.
- `12-fizzbuzz.py`: A function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 according to the FizzBuzz rules.
- `13-insert_number.c`: A C function that inserts a number into a sorted linked list.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you should clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mwanikigachanja/alx-higher_level_programming.git
```

You can then navigate to the project folder and start working on the tasks.

## Running the Scripts

You can run the Python scripts using the following command:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

For example, to run the `0-positive_or_negative.py` script:

```bash
python 0-positive_or_negative.py
```

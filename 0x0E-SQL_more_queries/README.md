# 0x0E-SQL_more_queries Project

## Overview

This project, 0x0E-SQL_more_queries, is a part of the Holberton School curriculum, specifically focused on advancing skills in SQL (Structured Query Language). The project covers more advanced SQL queries, including subqueries, joins, and other complex database operations.

## Description

The 0x0E-SQL_more_queries project consists of several SQL scripts that demonstrate the application of advanced SQL concepts. Each script focuses on a specific topic, providing a hands-on learning experience for the developer. The project aims to enhance the understanding of SQL and its application in database management.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple SQL script files, each addressing a particular aspect of SQL queries. The structure of the project is as follows:

- **0-advanced_join.sql**: Introduction to advanced JOIN operations.
- **1-never_empty.sql**: Learn to use OUTER JOIN to retrieve non-matching data.
- **2-left_join.sql**: Practice LEFT JOIN to fetch data from two tables.
- **3-find_boring.sql**: Apply NULL values and IS NULL in SQL queries.
- **4-unique_gift.sql**: Explore DISTINCT and GROUP BY for unique data retrieval.
- **5-unique_gift.sql**: Work with more advanced GROUP BY operations.
- **6-no_order.sql**: Understand ORDER BY in SQL queries.
- **7-avg_score.sql**: Calculate average values using AVG in SQL.
- **8-logs.sql**: Gain insights into subqueries with nested SELECT statements.
- **9-strive_for_the_best.sql**: Practice more subqueries with multiple conditions.
- **10-main_course.sql**: Apply JOINs, subqueries, and advanced SQL concepts in comprehensive queries.
- **100-move_to_utf8.sql**: Convert a MySQL database from ASCII to UTF-8 encoding.

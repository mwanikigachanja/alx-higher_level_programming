# 0x03-python-data_structures

## Overview

Welcome to the 0x03-python-data_structures project folder! In this project, you'll dive into the world of Python data structures and explore the inner workings of various data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more. By the end of this project, you'll have a deeper understanding of these data structures and how to use them effectively in your Python programs.

## Files and their Functions

Here's a breakdown of the related files in this project and what each one does:

1. **0-square_matrix_simple.py** - This file contains a Python function `square_matrix_simple(matrix=[])` that computes the square of each element in a matrix (2D list) and returns the result as a new matrix. It's a great exercise in working with 2D lists and list comprehensions.

2. **1-search_replace.py** - This file includes a Python function `search_replace(my_list, search, replace)` that replaces all occurrences of an element `search` in a list `my_list` with the element `replace`. It's a useful function for modifying lists.

3. **2-uniq_add.py** - In this file, you'll find a Python function `uniq_add(my_list)` that takes a list `my_list`, removes duplicates, and returns the sum of the unique elements. It's a practical exercise in working with sets and list manipulation.

4. **3-common_elements.py** - This file contains a Python function `common_elements(set_1, set_2)` that returns a set containing the common elements of two sets, `set_1` and `set_2`. It's a great example of how to work with sets in Python.

5. **4-only_diff_elements.py** - Here, you'll find a Python function `only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2)` that returns a set containing all the elements that are unique to each of the two sets, `set_1` and `set_2`. This is another example of set manipulation.

6. **5-number_keys.py** - This file contains a Python function `number_keys(a_dict)` that returns the number of keys in a dictionary. It's a straightforward dictionary operation.

7. **6-print_sorted_dictionary.py** - In this file, you'll discover a Python function `print_sorted_dictionary(a_dict)` that prints a dictionary sorted by keys. It's a useful function for visualizing dictionary data.

## Project Experience and Gained Skills

# 0x06-python-classes

## Description
This Python project explores the concept of classes and object-oriented programming (OOP). It covers the basics of defining classes, creating instances, and working with attributes and methods. The code examples provided illustrate how to use classes to model real-world entities, encapsulate data, and promote code reusability.

## Examples
### Defining a Class
```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}")

# Create an instance of the Car class
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022)

# Access attributes and call methods
print(my_car.make)          # Output: Toyota
my_car.display_info()       # Output: 2022 Toyota Camry
```

### Inheritance
```python
class ElectricCar(Car):
    def __init__(self, make, model, year, battery_capacity):
        super().__init__(make, model, year)
        self.battery_capacity = battery_capacity

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model} (Electric)")

# Create an instance of the ElectricCar class
my_electric_car = ElectricCar("Tesla", "Model S", 2022, 75)

# Call overridden method from the parent class
my_electric_car.display_info()  # Output: 2022 Tesla Model S (Electric)
```

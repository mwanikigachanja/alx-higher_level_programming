# 0x0D-SQL Introduction
## Overview
This project introduces the fundamentals of SQL (Structured Query Language) and its application in managing relational databases. SQL is a powerful language used for interacting with databases, allowing you to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data efficiently.
## Project Structure
The project is organized into several tasks, each focusing on different aspects of SQL. The tasks cover topics such as creating databases, tables, and performing various SQL operations.
### Task List
1. 0-list_databases.sql: Display the existing databases.
2. 1-create_database_if_missing.sql: Create a new database if it doesn't already exist.
3. 2-remove_database.sql: Remove an existing database.
4. 3-list_tables.sql: List the tables in a database.
5. 4-first_table.sql: Create a simple table with predefined columns.
6. 5-full_table.sql: Create a more complex table with additional constraints.
7. 6-list_values.sql: Insert and retrieve data from a table.
8. 7-update_value.sql: Update existing data in a table.
9. 8-rid_of_underscore.sql: Rename a column in a table.
10. 9-foreign_keys.sql: Create and manage foreign keys.

# 0x14-javascript-web_scraping

This repository contains the solutions to the **0x14-javascript-web_scraping** project, which is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum.

## Description

In this project, we explore web scraping using JavaScript and Node.js. We utilize libraries such as `request` and `cheerio` to fetch web pages and extract data from them. The project covers various tasks related to web scraping, such as fetching data from an API, scraping a web page, and manipulating extracted data.

## Files

- `0-readme.js`: JavaScript script that reads and prints the content of a file.
- `1-writeme.js`: JavaScript script that writes a string to a file.
- `2-statuscode.js`: JavaScript script that displays the status code of a GET request.
- `3-starwars_title.js`: JavaScript script that prints the title of a Star Wars movie where the episode number matches a given integer.
- `4-starwars_count.js`: JavaScript script that prints the number of movies where the character "Wedge Antilles" is present.
- `5-request_store.js`: JavaScript script that gets the contents of a webpage and stores it in a file.
- `6-completed_tasks.js`: JavaScript script that computes the number of tasks completed by user id.

## Requirements

- Node.js installed
- `request` and `cheerio` libraries installed (`npm install request cheerio`)

## Usage

To run any of the scripts, use the following command:

```bash
node <script_name>.js
```

Replace `<script_name>` with the name of the script you want to execute.

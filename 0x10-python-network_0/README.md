## Usage

To use the scripts, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mwanikigachanja/alx-higher_level_programming.git
```

Then navigate to the `0x10-python-network_0` directory:

```bash
cd alx-higher_level_programming/0x10-python-network_0
```

Execute the desired script using Bash:

# 0x11-python-network_1

This repository contains solutions to the tasks in the 0x11-python-network_1 project, part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum.

## Description

The 0x11-python-network_1 project focuses on advancing network programming skills in Python. It covers topics such as making HTTP requests with urllib, handling URL parameters, working with JSON data, and understanding APIs.

## Tasks

1. **URLs**:
   - Write a Python script that fetches data from a URL using urllib.

2. **HTTP headers**:
   - Write a Python script that takes in a URL and displays the value of the X-Request-Id header.

3. **HTTP method**:
   - Write a Python script that sends a POST request with a specific email as a parameter.

4. **Fetch to a URL**:
   - Write a Python script that fetches a URL, displays the body of the response, and handles errors.

5. **Response header value #1**:
   - Write a Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL, and displays the value of the X-Request-Id header in the response.

6. **POST an email #0**:
   - Write a Python script that sends a POST request to a URL with email as a parameter.

## Usage

To use the scripts, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mwanikigachanja/alx-higher_level_programming.git
```

Then navigate to the `0x11-python-network_1` directory:

```bash
cd alx-higher_level_programming/0x11-python-network_1
```

Execute the desired script using Python:

```bash
python3 <script_name>
```

Replace `<script_name>` with the name of the script you want to run.

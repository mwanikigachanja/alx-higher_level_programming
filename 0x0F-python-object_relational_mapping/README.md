# 0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping

This project is a part of the curriculum at ALX Higher Level Programming, authored by Charles Mwaniki.

## Introduction

This project aims to bridge the gap between Python programming and relational databases by exploring Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) techniques. It primarily focuses on utilizing MySQL databases with Python, leveraging both raw SQL queries and ORM using SQLAlchemy.

## Background Context

In this project, we'll delve into two significant aspects:

1. **MySQL Connectivity**: Initially, we'll establish connections to a MySQL database using the `MySQLdb` module, enabling the execution of SQL queries directly.
   
2. **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**: Following that, we'll transition to using SQLAlchemy, a powerful ORM tool. ORM abstracts the database interaction, allowing seamless integration of database operations within Python code without the need for explicit SQL queries.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, learners should be able to:

- Understand the significance of Python programming in database interactions.
- Establish connections to MySQL databases from Python scripts.
- Perform SELECT and INSERT operations on MySQL tables using Python scripts.
- Comprehend the concept of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and its advantages.
- Map Python classes to MySQL tables effortlessly.
- Create Python Virtual Environments for isolated dependency management.

## Requirements

### General

- **Editors**: Allowed editors include vi, vim, and emacs.
- **Execution Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Python 3.8.5.
- **Libraries**: `MySQLdb` version 2.0.x, `SQLAlchemy` version 1.4.x.
- **File Structure**: All files must end with a new line and start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **Code Style**: Ensure adherence to `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*).
- **Documentation**: All modules, classes, and functions must have proper documentation explaining their purpose.
- **MySQLdb Installation**: MySQLdb version 2.0.x setup as per provided instructions.
- **SQLAlchemy Installation**: SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x setup as per provided instructions.

### README.md

A detailed README.md file is mandatory and should cover:

- Project overview and objectives.
- Installation instructions for MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy.
- How to create and activate Python Virtual Environment (venv).
- Guidelines for executing and testing the project.
- Explanation of ORM and its significance.
- References to relevant tutorials and resources.
